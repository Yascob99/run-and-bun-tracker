# Run and Bun Tracker

## General Information

Run and Bun Tracker is a collection of lua scripts for the [Bizhawk emulator](https://tasvideos.org/BizHawk/ReleaseHistory) (v2.8 or higher) used to better vistualize your party and other functions coming soon.

This project is based on [MKDasher's PokemonBizhawkLua project](https://github.com/mkdasher/PokemonBizhawkLua). I also referenced the Run and Bun MGBA export script for lua and Ironmon Tracker for certain methods and important memory addresses to look for.
